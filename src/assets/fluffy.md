# Where is Fluffy?

*Where is Fluffy* is a short game, made as an exercise in interactive narrative design. Its story revolves around Robin, who wakes up scared in the middle of the night and can't find their stuffed animal to comfort them. You set out to find him in the dark...{.intro}

We put a lot of effort in this game and it has become very good.
