Born out of a fascination with nature and programming, this tree generator lets anyone create stylish, low-poly trees out of nowhere.{.intro}

## How it works
The trees are generated from an armature. The armature consists of a stem and a few branches. The stem is created by selecting random points upwards with a maximum deviation of the angle between the world z-axis and the next segment of the stem.
