THis HKU course in Graphics Programming challenged us to program visuals with a minimal framework.{.intro}

After implementing basic **shaders**, **matrix transformations** and post-processing effects such as **FXAA**, I decided to make things a bit easier by creating my own **post-processing stack** that allows you to switch effects on and off on the fly and mix them together. I finally made a very basic **scene manager** that even lets you switch scenes at runtime.
