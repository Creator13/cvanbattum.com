As I was mapping missing buildings the village of Bathurst and surroundings, I started to wonder about the statistics of all the buildings I was placing. I was particularly interested in knowing how many buildings there were of each polygon. Out of this, the building analyzer was born{.intro}

Besides dynamically counting the buildings in the area, it's possible to save the downloaded data as well as the results into a file, which I could use to track my progress over the months of mapping this village. They can also be nicely visualized. Keeping into account extensibility, the queries can be swapped for different areas or for different users.
