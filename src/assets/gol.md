Console version of Conway's game of life, written in C++.{.intro}

I made this simple command-line version of Conway's Game of Life as part of the course *Object-Oriented programming in C++ Advanced*. Part of the assignment was to implement support for different rulesets for cell-based automata. I implemented this using the strategy pattern and a ruleset interface. An optimization could be to not use inheritance so there would be no expensive virtual method calls.
