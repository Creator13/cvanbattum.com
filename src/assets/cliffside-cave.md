Under the old farmhouse was a cellar, partially built into the ground. It had clearly seen better days, but it looked like it was still regularly used as a storage shed of sorts. The air inside was damp and dusty, but most of all, it was very dark. Only one small window in the side of the wall allowed light to come through.{.intro}

This cave-like cellar under a farmhouse was inspired by my own experiences with spaces like this in the French countryside. It challenged me to learn software like Substance Painter and work with lighting in Unity.

Made for the Environmental Modelling course at the HKU.
